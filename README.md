## UC8: Refactoring LengthUnit to Standalone Enum

## Description
Extracts `LengthUnit` from inside `QuantityLength` into a standalone top-level class. Assigns conversion responsibility to the enum itself. `QuantityLength` is simplified to delegate all conversions to unit methods. All UC1–UC7 functionality preserved.

## Flow
1. `LengthUnit` enum handles `convertToBaseUnit()` and `convertFromBaseUnit()`.
2. `QuantityLength` delegates all conversions to unit methods.
3. Public API remains unchanged → backward compatible.

## Key Concepts
- Single Responsibility: `LengthUnit` converts, `QuantityLength` compares/adds
- Eliminates circular dependency for multi-category scaling
- Pattern template for future `WeightUnit`, `VolumeUnit`, etc.
