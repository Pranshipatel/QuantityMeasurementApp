#  📏 UC6: Addition of Two Length Units

## Description
Extends UC5 by adding two `QuantityLength` objects (potentially different units). Result is expressed in the unit of the first operand. Both operands are normalized to base unit before summing.

## Flow
1. Validate both operands (non-null, finite, valid units).
2. Convert both to base unit (feet).
3. Sum converted values.
4. Convert sum → first operand's unit.
5. Return new `QuantityLength` (immutability preserved).

## Key Concepts
- Immutability: addition returns new instance
- Commutativity: `add(A, B)` = `add(B, A)`
- Method overloading for flexible API
